    <P>Words can't describe how sad I am right now knowing that you have given up on me. The worst part is knowing it is my own fault because I didn't listen to you and give you the space you needed. I am so sorry for all the stupid things I have said and done. You are the most amazing girl I have ever met, and the best girlfriend any guy could want. You are truly beautiful on the inside and out.It's hurting me so much to know I have ruined it with you. I've ruined your heart. If only there was a reset button I could press because I love you so much. That is why i will cook your favourite meal today lasagna.</P>
